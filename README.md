Efficient and effective use of Modelling & Simulation (M&S) capabilities requires standards for connecting and integrating M&S components across the training system enterprise.

The NATO Education and Training Network Federation Architecture and FOM Design (NETN FAFD) is a NATO Allied Modelling and Simulation Publication (AMSP-04) covered by a NATO standard recommendation (STANREC 4800). 

AMSP-04 specifies how to represent and share data in distributed simulation environments where M&S services (federates) are connected and federated using the NATO mandated IEEE 1516 High-Level Architecture (HLA) standard (STANAG 4603).

AMSP-04 includes the NETN FOM as an HLA Federation Object Model (FOM) consisting of a set of modules that defines classes of objects and interactions used to exchange information in a distributed simulation.
