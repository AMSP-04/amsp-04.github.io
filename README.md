# NATO Education and Training Network Federation Object Model

Efficient and effective use of NATO and national Modelling & Simulation (M&S) capabilities requires standards for connecting and integrating M&S components across the training system enterprise.

NETN FAFD is a NATO standard recommendation (STANREC 4800) for representing shared data in distributed simulation environments where M&S services (federates) are connected and federated using the NATO mandated High-Level Architecture standard (STANAG 4603).
